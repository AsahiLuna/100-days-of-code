## Log

### R1D1 
The project was initialized, including unit tests and the E2E test framework, with a little documentation.

Project: [resumes](https://github.com/alpgocc/resumes)

### R1D2
Update homepage and add the 'info' component, add some dependencies like the font-awesome and element UI. Also, I do the unit test for the 'info' module's logic part. But I do not add the CSS style yet, Maybe I will do it tonight or tomorrow.

### R1D3
Update info module CSS style, include container and socials icons, tomorrow I will add the i18n and start to write other modules.

### R1D4
I realized I couldn't just start writing new modules, and before that, I needed to solve the data problem.
So I refactored my code and using Vuex to managing the data.
Most of that hour was spent thinking, not write the code.
I hope I can do better tomorrow.


#R1D5
I added a unit test and editing module, but it does not work through yet. Maybe I need to upgrade my Vue unit test skill, my unit test cases are not good enough. I decided to figure out how to write simply and useful unit test case with Vue this weekend.
