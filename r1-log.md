## Log

### R1D1 
The project was initialized, including unit tests and the E2E test framework, with a little documentation.

Project: [resumes](https://github.com/alpgocc/resumes)

### R1D2
Update homepage and add the 'info' component, add some dependencies like the font-awesome and element UI. Also, I do the unit test for the 'info' module's logic part. But I do not add the CSS style yet, Maybe I will do it tonight or tomorrow.
